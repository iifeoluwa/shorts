###### What's this?

Glad you asked. Basically a re-incarnation of `bit.ly` v1. Bu- buh- but whyyy? You ask. Why not? I respond.:D

#### How to run

Few steps are required to get up and running;

- Ensure you have [Docker](https://docker.com) installed and set up.
- Clone the project to a local directory.
- Make a copy of the `.env.dist` file and rename it to `.env`
- Run `docker-compose up -d`
- App should be running on port `3000` on your `localhost` ðŸŽ‰

Once the app is running, documentation for the available endpoints would be accessible at `/docs` path.
